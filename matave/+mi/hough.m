% Hough transform - Line detection algorthm
% Input: X(Data matrix of an edge image), N(Amout of sloped lines), radius(This is a way to make sure you don't select the same K and M value again)
% Output: K(Slopes), M(Bias), R(Projected distance), T(Radians angle of the projected distance)
% Example 1: [K, M, R, T] = mi.hough(X, N);
% Example 2: [K, M, R, T] = mi.hough(X, N, radius);
